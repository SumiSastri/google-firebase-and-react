# Choosing between Firebase and AWS

Firebase is google's cloud infrastructure and Amazon Web Services is a competitor service. Using one over the other is a matter of use case, personal choice and preference.

To develop this opinion, I am working on this Firebase project and will make a final comparision when I have worked on similar AWS Services.

Some of the docs in this section come from reading and research, rather than personal experience.

Firebase Usecase - good for front end devs who do not want to set up infra, small projects

AWS Use case - if you need to scale business and have funds to pay staff and for AWS managed services. Pay-as-you-go model, so you can limit costs, need to set it all up yourself
