# Setting up a Firebase account

If you have a google account sign in and go to the [Firebase site](https://firebase.google.com/) in the top right corner you should see you already have an account you can now create a new project and give it a name.

This is the free tier for developers.

Accept terms and default settings and in the background the spinner should start configuring your backend with Firebase. On the prompt your Firebase project is ready.

Under the cog Project Overview you will see the Build, Release and Monitior, Analytics and Engagle tools. And you will see you have been set up with the Spark account - no cost.

# The Firebase admin console

Go to the [Firebase Admin Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) this is where all your Firebase projects will be listed. On the top right you will also get the latest official documentation - click the docs icon.

[Firebase Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs) is easy to read and follow and is a great reference for trouble shooting.
