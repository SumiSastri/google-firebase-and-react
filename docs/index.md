This is a Google Firebase App using V9 and React on the front end.

Firebase was initially a chat app created by a startup in 2001, it was acquired by google in 2014. Alphabet, google's parent company, has changed the app into a cloud services platform.

It is ideal for small teams and start-ups, it is less scalable for enterprise-size apps. At the time of writing (2023) Firebase has upgraded to [V9](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/modular-upgrade) from V8 and recommends upgrades to V9 as it offers a more modular framework for development.
